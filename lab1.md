# Lab 1 Report

## cd command

1. No arguments
   
![Image](cd_noarg.png)

Working directory: root (~/). 

There was no output because when we do the cd command with no argument, there is no directory given to change to so we stay in the same directory and no change occurs.
This is not technically an error since the command still processes--it's just that there's no directory change since no argument was given.

2. Directory

![Image](cd_dir.png)

Working directory: root(~/).

We get sent to the lecture1 directory because we gave `lecture1` as an argument, allowing us to change directories properly. This is reflected in the terminal in line 2, as shown here: `[user@sahara ~/lecture1]`. 
This is not an error.
