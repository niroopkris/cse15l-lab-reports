# Lab 4 Report

## Step 4: Log into SSH

Keys pressed: `<up><up><enter>`. The `ssh nkrishnakumar@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command was 2 up in my search history so I accessed it with the up arrow (it was in my history since I had done steps 4-9 as practice before this report).

## Step 5: Clone Repository Fork

Keys pressed: `<Ctrl-R>clone<enter>`. I thought pressing <up> to search for the `git clone git@github.com:nk4444/lab7.git` command might take a while so I used `<Ctrl-R>` to access my bash history and searched for `clone`. The command was found and the clone occurred successfully.

## Step 6: Run Tests (Fail)

Keys pressed: `<up><up><up><up><enter>`, then `<Ctrl-R>bash<enter>`. The `cd lab7` command, which I needed to move from my home directory to `lab7`, was 4 up in my search history so I accessed it with the up arrow. Then I searched for the `bash test.sh` command by using `<Ctrl-R>` and typing `bash` (since I was pretty sure it would take more `<up>` keys to reach than the `cd lab7` command). Thus, the tests ran and failed as expected.
